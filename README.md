# wills_ideas
This is an extension for typo3 9.4 and older in which the frontend user can create small posts with short text, a category, an image and a like button.

Missing:
Fall back if the editor forgot to set a private side for loged users at the frontend. If the extension is set for all users once you try to create an idea you will get an error message of not finding the logged user id.
